# Versioning

Software versioning tracks and communicates changes in software. It can also be applied to documents and data, among others. 

## Description 

Code is often a living thing. Changes are made in order to add new capabilities, fix errors or things that donâ€™t work well, and stay up to date with changes in other software that the code needs to run (dependencies). Applying a standardized versioning scheme has many benefits, a few of which are:

* communicating that something has changed 
* communicating how big of a change was made
* using a specific state (version) of the code for reproducibility of the output or successful operation in a particular environment
* tracing when or how a particular problem was introduced

_What is the difference between versioning and version control?_
This is a common and valid question, since tools like Git can be used for both. 

* *Versioning* is the practice of designating different states of code. This tends to occur at a relatively coarse level, rolling up many changes and assigning a specific version identifier that provides information about the changes. 
* *Version control* is applied at a very fine level. Each and every change is tracked character by character and line by line, and you can go back to previous states of the code and/or see the full history of changes. 
  
There are many different versioning schemes in practice. Rather than appending a "_v2" to your file name, there are sophisticated yet simple versioning schemes along with free tools that do most of the work. See the resources below for links to descriptions of major schemes as well as free tools.

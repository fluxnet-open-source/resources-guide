# Best Practice Tiers

Below are a set of best practices recommended for every level of coding proficiency, organized in three tiers from "Must-do" to "Well-rounded" to "Amazing!". Rather than an exhaustive list, these represent a core set of practices to help progressively improve the access, usability, and robustness of code produced by the FLUXNET community.

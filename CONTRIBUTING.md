Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Read the [documentation](https://fluxnet-open-source.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) carefully and find out if the documentation or tutorial is already covered.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/fluxnet-open-source/website/issues?q=) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/fluxnet-open-source/website/issues?q=).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Fluxnet Open Source Code Committee Resource Guide users. 

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Reporting a Bug

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

Bugs can happen in our tutorials or even code snippets in the documentation. if you find a bug, please report it. A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://fluxnet-open-source.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the (https://github.com/fluxnet-open-source/website/issues?q=).
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/fluxnet-open-source/website/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. 
- For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case. This makes it easier to reproduce and fix the bug.
  - A minimally reproducible example is a piece of code that demonstrates the problem you are reporting. This makes it easier to understand the problem and to find a solution.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

## Overview

The FLUXNET Open Source Website is designed to be a dynamic and informative platform for the FLUXNET community. It is built using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/), which allows us to create and manage content in Markdown. We aim to provide valuable resources and tutorials to help users learn about and utilize open-source software effectively.

## Resource Guide

The Resource Guide is a collection of software and general open-source code development topics that are relevant . It covers a wide range of tools and technologies, including using git, documenting your code, error handling, logging, CI/CD, and more. The guide is designed to be jumping off points for users to learn more about these topics and explore further, with links provided to additional resources.

## Tutorials

The Tutorials section provides step-by-step guides to help users get started with different tools and technologies. These tutorials are designed to be accessible to users with varying levels of experience, from beginners to advanced users.

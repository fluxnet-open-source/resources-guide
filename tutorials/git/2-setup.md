GitHub Desktop is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) easy-to-use application that simplifies using Git and GitHub on your computer. The main advantages of using GitHub Desktop include:

- Low learning curve: GitHub Desktop is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, making it a great choice for beginners. If you're new to Git and GitHub, GitHub Desktop can help you get started quickly.
- GitHub Integration. GitHub Desktop is specifically designed for use with GitHub, making it easy to work with your GitHub repositories. You can clone repositories, create branches, commit changes, and push changes to GitHub directly from the application.
- Encourages best practices. GitHub Desktop guides you through common Git workflows, such as creating a new branch, committing changes, and pushing changes to a remote repository. This can help you follow best practices and avoid common mistakes.
- Find commands. Because of its graphical interface, GitHub Desktop can help you find the commands you need to perform common Git operations. This can be especially helpful if you're not familiar with the command-line interface.

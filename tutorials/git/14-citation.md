# Citation

When you publish your code, you want to make sure that others can cite it.
The best way to do this is to include a `CITATION` file in the root directory of your repository. One easy way to do this is to connect your code to a place like Zenodo, which will automatically generate a DOI for your code and provide a citation format for others to use.

You can find information on how to do this in the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/), and on the [Zenodo documentation](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/profile/linking-accounts/).

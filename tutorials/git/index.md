# Version Control, Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, keeps track of every modification to the code, and can help revert to a previous version if necessary, but even if you are working alone, it can make things so much easier.
